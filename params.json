That's why Droppy automatically appends an 8-letter random string to every filename, so you can't just download every file you didn't get direct access to. This way people won't be able to guess the public URL for a known file in your Public/ folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Optional screenshot uploader\r\n\r\nSo there is [puush](http://puush.me/) for Windows, which is a super handy tool to share screenshots instantly, but is not available on Linux... I wanted to create the same experience with Droppy, so I did, with the help of Compiz. (this is compiz-dependant in my case, but you could likely use some other tools, like Shutter or etc.)\r\n\r\nThe main components are:\r\n\r\n* a screenshooter tool, which should paste the images in `~/Screenshots/.incoming/`\r\n* a background script, which periodically scans this directory\r\n* Droppy, which does its thing\r\n\r\nHow to set up:\r\n\r\n* Tell your screenshooter to paste images into `~/Screenshots/.incoming/`\r\n  * With Compiz, you can set it by opening CompizConfig Settings Manager, enabling the Screenshot plugin, and setting the \"Save Directory\"\r\n* The script `ss_monitor.sh` is the monitoring one, set it to automatically start when you log in your computer.\r\n  * You probably have some GUI to set the startup applications, do it there.\r\n* Take screenshots and feel the convenience!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nMIT.",
